        My purpose for this capstone is to help anyone interested in developing
        <br>
        their own website. Like me who was curious enough to join the App/Dev 
        <br>
        program, I want to show others who are beginners or just want to understand
        <br>
        what makes a good website.

        <b>- Ever wanted to create your own website but you don't know where to start?
          <br><br>
          - Hopefully by the end of scrolling through this website, you will at least
          be a bit more familiar with coding.
