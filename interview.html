          For my interview I decided to speak to a former Dacc student, Ashton
          Westrick. We were able to contact each other through email.
          <br><br>
          On this side will be some of the questions I asked him:

          <br><br>

          <ul id="interview">
            <li>- Did you already know that this type of career
               was the one that you wanted?</li>

            <br>

            <li>- Any expectations before entering the workforce?</li>

            <br><br>

            <li>- What does a normal day at work look like?</li>

            <br><br>

            <li>- What do you think is the hardest aspect for this type
               of career?</li>

            <br><br>

            <li>- Any tips you would give to yourself in the past?</li>
              
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div id="right_div">
          This is the right side
