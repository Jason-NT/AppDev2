          Interview with Ashton Westrick

        <div id="left_div">
          For my interview I decided to speak to a former Dacc student, Ashton
          Westrick. We were able to contact each other through email.
          <br><br>
          On this side will be some of the questions I asked him:

          <br><br>

          <ul id="interview">
            <li>- Did you already know that this type of career
               was the one that you wanted?</li>

            <br>

            <li>- Any expectations before entering the workforce?</li>
              
            <br><br>

            <li>- What does a normal day at work look like?</li>

            <br><br>

            <li>- What do you think is the hardest aspect for this type
               of career?</li>

            <br><br>

            <li>- Any tips you would give to yourself in the past?</li>
              
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div id="right_div">
          <li>I knew that Cyber Security was something I wanted to get into since High School.  I deviated from that my sophomore year because,
             at the time, there was no Cyber Sec class at the DACC, so I took the ADP class instead, I believe you guys call it ADaPT now.
               When the Cyber Sec class was created my senior year, I worked with them on a Capture the Flag project and rediscoverd how cool cyber was.
                 I have always been very certain that I wanted work with computers and make the world a safer place.  Cyber Sec is perfect for both.

          </li>

         <br>

         <li>Before I got started working I expected that it would all be a very formal affair, regardless of weather I went into Cyber Sec or AppDev.
             I expected to go into work with at least a collared shirt and slave it out in a cubical.  I had a very pessimistic look on work, but hey maybe I could deal with it to pay the bills.
               What actually happened was I found that my team and the people I work with are pretty relaxed.  It is not uncommon for us go off topic a little bit during a meeting and talk about the local football game or an interest of ours.
               Heck, my boss and I took a few minutes to discuss the new Halo game a few weeks ago before we started on the official stuff.  Granted we never let these conversations truly distract us from our goals, but we can have fun when we need to.
                There is still that air of professionalism but it's not stifling like I expected it to be.</li>
           
         <br><br>

         <li>Really It depends on the day.  Typically, in the morning we have a team meeting discussing which action plans are due or what projects we have going.
             If you do daily standups in class, it's not too dissimilar.  Then it varies from there, often I'll have a meeting with some of my closer team members to discuss the specifics of the day,
              What each member should do, who do we need to get into contact with, things like that.  Typically then we'll have time to do that work.  I'm typically sending emails, initiating scans,
             writing python scripts that'll cleanup and categorize our scan results.  Then some days we'll have meetings with different teams for certain projects and on Mondays and Wednesdays we have weekly meetings going over our work on a year scale.
             “What do we have to do to get X done by the end of the year”.   My position is entirely online, so when I do my work it's on a virtual machine on a server run by AEP, that way if I get my laptop stolen, I don't risk company data.</li>

         <br><br>

         <li>I think the hardest part of this field, regardless of whether you’re in Cyber Sec or development, is communication.  Even when everyone was in the office,
            communication was hard.  Making sure you convey exactly what is needed is key no matter what you do, and it's easy to mess up.  Especially when you're new.
              Most likely you'll come across company specific lingo that you wouldn’t have heard before and you'll have to adapt to it and begin using it yourself.  How easy this is, is entirely dependent on who you are.</li>

         <br><br>

         <li>If I could give my past self any tips it would be to focus more on getting things done right, and don't try to rush them because of a perceived lack of time.  As the saying goes, if you don't have time do it right the first time,
            when will you have time to do it right a second time?</li>
